## What is Superposition?

In quantum mechanics, particles can exist in multiple states at the same time. A quantum particle can be in two places, spin in two directions, or have two energies simultaneously—until we measure it.

This isn't just theoretical. It's experimentally verified and used in quantum computers today.

## Schrödinger's Cat

The famous thought experiment illustrates this: a cat in a box is both alive and dead until you open the box and observe it. While dramatic, it captures the essence of quantum superposition.

```python
# Quantum state before measurement
quantum_state = 0.5 * |alive⟩ + 0.5 * |dead⟩

# After measurement: collapse to one state
observed_state = |alive⟩  # or |dead⟩
```

## Why It Matters

Superposition enables:
- **Quantum computing** - processing multiple calculations simultaneously
- **Quantum cryptography** - unbreakable encryption
- **Precision sensors** - detecting gravitational waves

The quantum world is strange, but it's real—and it's changing technology forever.
