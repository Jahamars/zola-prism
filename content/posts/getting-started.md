Welcome to **Prism** — a modern Zola theme designed for developers who appreciate clean aesthetics and smooth animations.


## Features Overview

- **Responsive Grid Layouts** — Your content looks great on any device
- **Syntax Highlighting** — Beautiful code blocks for technical posts
- **Tag System** — Organize posts by topics
- **Reading Time** — Automatically calculated for each post
- **Fast & Lightweight** — Optimized for performance

## Typography That Shines

The theme uses carefully selected typography with proper hierarchy and spacing. Headers stand out with volumetric effects, while body text remains highly readable.
```rust
// Code looks beautiful too!
pub fn main() {
    println!("Hello from Prism!");
}
```

## Getting Started

Installation is simple:

1. Clone the theme into your `themes` directory
2. Set `theme = "prism"` in your `config.toml`
3. Customize colors and settings as needed
4. Start writing!
